We put together a custom semi-strict item filter for Path of Exile 2. It’s designed to be simple and flexible, making it perfect for leveling, early mapping, or players who want a cleaner screen without missing anything important.

Features:
1.Balanced Filtering
Keeps useful items like good rares for Ranger (or any Bow Evasion playstyle i guess?)
Hides low-value junk to reduce clutter.

2.Customizable
Easy to tweak for stricter or more lenient filtering based on your playstyle.
Editable sections for specific league mechanics or personal preferences.

3.Modern Look
Clean colors, sounds, and labels for quick identification of item importance.

Why Semi-Strict?

This filter is great for:
Casual Mapping: Hides garbage without being overly strict.
Testing POE2 Content: Easy to adjust for new mechanics or items
